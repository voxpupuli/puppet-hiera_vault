# sandbox

This is a basic docker-compose sandbox that creates a Puppetserver with the working directory of hiera-vault, a vault server with a KV mounted, and a puppet agent.

## Setup

```
$ docker compose up -d --build

You can now jump into the agent or the Puppetserver and test things.

For example, to quickly test the module is working as expected:

```
$ docker-compose run --entrypoint='puppet lookup vault_notify --explain --compile --node=node1.vm' puppet
Creating sandbox_puppet_run ... done
Searching for "lookup_options"
  Global Data Provider (hiera configuration version 5)
    Using configuration "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml"
    Hierarchy entry "Hiera-vault lookup"
      No such key: "lookup_options"
      [hiera-vault] Skipping hiera_vault backend because key 'lookup_options' does not match confine_to_keys
Searching for "vault_notify"
  Global Data Provider (hiera configuration version 5)
    Using configuration "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml"
    Hierarchy entry "Hiera-vault lookup"
      Found key: "vault_notify" value: "'Hello World'"
      [hiera-vault] Client configured to connect to http://vault:8200
      [hiera-vault] Looking in path some_secret/common for vault_notify
      [hiera-vault] Checking path: some_secret/common/data/vault_notify

      [hiera-vault] Checking path: some_secret/common/vault_notify
      [hiera-vault] Read secret: vault_notify
```

We can see that things are working.

Then, lets say we change some code, and add an extra line:

```
$ docker-compose run --entrypoint='puppet lookup vault_notify --explain --compile --node=node1.vm' puppet | grep 'just added'
Creating sandbox_puppet_run ... done
      [hiera-vault] Hello Docker, I just added some code
```
